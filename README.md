# Tor Relay Configurations

This is a simple, sample configuration file that I actively use on my own Tor middle relay.

This repository should allow anyone to launch their own Tor relay on their own machines in less than 3 minutes. If you need more information as to what a *Tor relay* is, consult [this link](https://community.torproject.org/relay/).

## Usage

* Install `tor` (the daemon, **not** the browser) on your Linux/*BSD system.
* Modify [the torrc file](etc/tor/torrc) with your own credentials.
* **If you're using systemd**, run `bash config.sh` in order to install and immediately deploy your new Tor relay.
* Make sure that the `ORPort` and the `DIRPort` ports you're using are open and accessible to the internet. If they're not, the log file (which, by default, will be created in `/var/log/tor/notices.log`) will alert you.

#### Disclaimer

This product is produced independently from the TorÂ® anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.

Although these configurations are meant for a Tor middle relay (which, in short, means that no Tor user traffic comes out of your own network onto the clear internet), **this will NOT mean that your IP address will not be subjected to blacklisting**, despite the fact that your node, by default, cannot pose any danger to anyone on the internet.
